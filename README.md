Graphs are encoded in the following format:  
1st line corresponds to two integers, separated by one space, represent the "source" and "destination" nodes  
2nd line = one integer, represents total number of nodes  
all subsequent lines contain three integers separated by a space:  
1st integer = 1st node in an edge, 2nd integer = 2nd node in an edge, 3rd integer = weight of the edge  
see ff1.txt or bf1.txt as examples
